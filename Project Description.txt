Majestic Titanic Drowned Killing Hundreds of Lives! (ML-TITANIC-01)
The majestic titanic just drowned killing hundreds of lives onboard. A huge tragedy dawned upon the family members of the victims. Because of this, the government issued a compensation fund of $50,000 to the family members of dead victims. Since a lot of victims are lost in the sea, so, the actual number of dead victims is not available to the government. You Being a government official, is assigned to the job of predicting the number of dead and alive victims as accurate as possible for the compensation fund.

The dataset of the victims with their properties like Name, Travelling Class, Age, etc  are provided. Train the machine learning model using train.csv and test it against the test.csv file. The Survived column of test.csv have 2 values as 1 (Alive) and 0 (Dead).

Team(s) having the highest accuracy will get 2 extra points.

All the teammates must contribute to the code. If not, the inactive members will be removed!


HINT: Machine Learning Models can work on only numbers! So to work on categorical data, like gender, assign a number to each category. For example, Gender Question can 3 options, Male, Female, Prefer not to answer. So, assign 0 to Male, 1 to Female and 3 to Prefer not to answer. So here you go! you got some numbers to work on!
